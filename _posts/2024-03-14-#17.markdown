In an alternate ending of "Shrek," instead of Shrek and Fiona living happily ever after, they discover a hidden portal that takes them to modern-day New York City. They end up starting a successful food truck business selling "Ogre's Delight" â€” a unique blend of swamp-inspired cuisine that becomes a hit among New Yorkers craving adventurous flavors. However, chaos ensues when Lord Farquaad discovers the portal and tries to take over the food truck empire for himself!
